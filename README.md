```zig
const std = @import("std");
const zigosc = @import("root.zig");
const Message = zigosc.Message;
const Value = zigosc.Value;

pub fn main() !void {
    var buf: [128]u8 = undefined;
    // Encode message
    var msg = Message.init("/x", "fff", &[_]Value{ .{ .f = 0.25 }, .{ .f = 0.5 }, .{ .f = 1.0 } });
    var num_bytes = try msg.encode(&buf);
    const data = buf[0..num_bytes]; // packed OSC data, suitable for transmission
    // Decode message
    var address: []const u8 = undefined;
    var typetag: []const u8 = undefined;
    var values: [3]Value = undefined;
    num_bytes = try Message.decode(data, &address, &typetag, &values);
    std.debug.print("address = {s} typetag = {s} values = [{}, {}, {}]\n", .{ address, typetag, values[0].f, values[1].f, values[2].f });
}
